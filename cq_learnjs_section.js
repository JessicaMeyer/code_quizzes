// What does the following expression return?
> 3 + 2;
5

// What does the following expression return?
> typeof(3);
"number"

// Notice that there is only a single data type for numbers, not seperate
// data types for integers and floating point numbers like Ruby.

// What does the following expression return?
typeof(3) === typeof(4.32);
true

// 3 is a "number" and 4.32 is a "number". JS has the same data type for integer
// and floating point numbers. 

// What does the following expression return?
> 5 / 0;
Infinity

// Technically division by 0 should be undefined, but not with JS

// What does the following expression return?
> 3 / "bob";
NaN

// Stands for "not a number" and is returned when a math operation 
// cannot yield a numeric result

// What does the following expression return?
> NaN === NaN;
false

// NaN is not equal to any other value, including itself.

// What does the following expression return?
> typeof(NaN);
"number"

// NaN has a "number type"

// What does the following expression return?
> isNaN(NaN);
true

// The isNaN method returns true if the arguement is NaN and false otherwise.

// What does the following expression return?
> Math.pow(2, 3);
8

// 2 raised to the power of 3

// Describe how the following expression assigns a variable to a value.
> var first_name = "cindy";

// var declares the variable, first_name is the keyword name of the variable, cindy is the value

// What is the value of the hello variable in the following expression?
> var hello;
undefined

// It is not assigned to any value, so undefined

// What does the following expression return?
> var y;
> y === "cool";
false

// The variable y is declared, but not assigned anything, so it is undefined. 
// When undefined is compared w/ the string "cool" with the ===, the return value is false. 

// What does the following expression return?
> "some" + " person";
"some person"

// What does the following expression return?
> var first = "Bart";
> var last = "Simpson";
> first + " " + last
"Bart Simpson"

// What does the following expression return?
> "cool".length;
4

// What does the following expression return?  Explain the answer.
> "phat" === "phat";
true

// What does the following expression return?
> typeof("cats");
String

// What does the following expression return?
> 3 + "bob"
"3bob"

// JS cannot add a number and a string without converting the # to a string first. 
// JS converts 3 to "3" and then concatenates the two strings. 

// Round the number 4.87 to the nearest integer.
Math.round(4.87)

// Divide the number 6 by the string "2" and explain the result.
> 6 / "2"
3

// JS cannot divide a number by a string, so it first converts the string to 
// a number, and then performs division. The string "2" can be converted to a number with this
// code Number("2"); 

// What does the following expression return?  Explain the result.
> 3 * "bob";
NaN

// JS attempts to convert "bob" to a number so multiplication can be performed, 
// but the string "bob" cannot be converted to a number. 

// Declare the variables x and y.
var x;
var y;

// Set the variable hobby to the string "programming".
var hobby = "programming";

// What does the following expression return?
> var sport; 
> sport === undefined

true

// A variable that has been declared, but has not been assigned is undefined. 

// Demonstrate that "brogrammer" has the type "string".

typeof("brogrammer");
=> "String"

"chatty" === "chatty";
true

// What does the following expression return?
3 <= 300
true

// Print the string "I just ate a lot" to the console.
console.log("I just ate a lot");

// if statements will execute the code in the block if the boolean 
// condition is true.  

// What does the following expression print to the console?

if (5 === 5) {
  console.log("This code is executed")
};
// prints "This code is executed" because if stmt evaluated true

// What does the following expression print to the console?

if (5 > 10) {
  console.log("Not so sure about this")
};
// Nothing is printed because the if stmt evaluates to false, amd there is no else stmt

} else {
  console.log("people are strange");
}
prints "just chill, have fun"

// What does the following expression print to the console?

if (5) { console.log("I like peanuts"); }

//"I like peanuts" is printed. 5 is considered truthy in a boolean context.

// ******* IMPORTANT******: In JS, undefined, NaN, null, 0, "", and the keyword false are all false in boolean context. 
// All other values are truthy.

// In Ruby nil and false are considered false.

// What doe the following expression print to the console?

if ("") {
  console.log("program more");
} else if ("cool") {
  console.log("party hard!");
} else {
  console.log("blah");
}
// "party hard!" is printed because "cool" is truthy, and it's the first truthy stmt evaluated. An empty string is falsey.

// What does the following expression return?
!false
true

// The ! operator returns the opposite of the boolean value it is prepended to.

// What does the following expression print to the console? 

if (!undefined) console.log("This syntax is weirdâ€¦");

// !undefined is true in a boolean context, so the block will run. 

// What does the following code print to the console?

var counter = 0;
while (counter < 3) {
  console.log("The counter is at " + counter);
  counter++
}
// The counter is at 0
// The counter is at 1
// The counter is at 2

// The while loop will execute the block as long as the boolean condition remains true. 

// What does the following code print to the console?

var result = 0;

  result += i;
}
console.log(result);

// What does the following code print to the console?

var writing_tools = ["pencil", "pen", "marker"];
console.log(writing_tools[writing_tools.length - 1]);
// "marker"

// writing_tools.length evaluates to 3 and writing_tools.length-1
// evaluates to 2. The final element of the array has an index 
// equal to the length of the array minus 1 (which is 2).

// What does the following code print to the console?

var b = [1, 2];

var great_show = "";
for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {

// strings in the word array + a space for each iteration of the for loop.

// What does the following statement return?

typeof(["cats"]);
Object 

// What does the following statement return?

[1, 89] === [1, 89];

// Even though they are the same elements, they are in different arrays so will return false.

// What does the following code return?

var blue = ["da ba dee da ba die"];
blue === blue;
// true

//In this example, the === operator is comparing two variables that point to 
// the same exact array, so true is returned.

// Sum all the elements in the following array if they are numbers, 
// otherwise ignore the element.  Print the result to the console.

var weird = [1, 40, "bob", [], false, 89];

var result = 0;

var beverages = ["beer", "wine", "shots"];
beverages[2] = "don't do it";

// What are the falsey values in JavaScript?  What does it mean when a value is falsey?

// Functions that are defined in an object are called methods.

// What does the following code print to the console?

var yao = {
  self: function () { return this }
